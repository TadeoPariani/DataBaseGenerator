# DataBaseGenerator
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```bash

npm install

```

Second, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

## Generating Tables and Models

Open http://localhost:3000 with your browser to see the project.

You have to log in using 'Todler' as the username and '1234' as the password.

You can create database models and their attributes using a simple form.

You can also create relationships between the models while you create them.

To see the models you have created, press the "Ver Tablas" button.

To generate the tables in the database and the model files, first press "Crear Tablas," and later press "Generar Modelos."

This will create the tables in the database as well as create those model tables in the /models folder.

## Integrantes
